Release 1.2.1 (2002-05-17):
---------------------------
o Changed the config scripts to look for the file config_freevo.py
  in /etc/freevo, ~/freevo and the current dir. This makes it easier
  to use a customized version that is not overwritten by new 
  releases.
o Removed fixed paths so that it should be able to run on most Linux systems,
  independently of where the applications are (/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, etc).
o Added a feature to playing movies where a file can be attached to each
  movie containing special arguments to MPlayer, e.g. aspect etc.
  The file is named <filename>.mplayer.
o Added logging to both stdout and /tmp/freevo.log
o Added freevo/testfiles, it is now the default in config.py and contains
  some movie/mp3 files for test purposes.
o Changed movie/music playlists to not repeat after playing all files.
  This should be configurable when playing in a later version.
o Changed remote control cursor left/right behavior in menus, making
  it easier to navigate.

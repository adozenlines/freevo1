  releases.

  independently of where the applications are (/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, etc).

  movie containing special arguments to MPlayer, e.g. aspect etc.
  The file is named <filename>.mplayer.

o Added freevo/testfiles, it is now the default in config.py and contains
  some movie/mp3 files for test purposes.

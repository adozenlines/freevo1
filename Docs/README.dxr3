DXR3
----

DXR3 from Creative Labs and the Hollywood Plus from Sigma Designs use the
em8300 chip and are possible to decode MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 streams and
generate video on the TV-out. 

There used to be support for the DXR3 board in Freevo, but unfortunately that
had to be dropped since the design was changed to use SDL only. SDL supports
a lot of different output methods (X11, Framebuffer, SVGA, etc), but it
doesn't support the DXR3 yet. This might change in the future.

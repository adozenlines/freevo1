XMLTV
-----

Abstract:
==

Freevo can now use the XMLTV format (http://xmltv.sourceforge.net/)
for TV listings. XMLTV downloads listings from a number of different
countries and regions into a standard XML based format. This is the
only way to get TV listings for Canada, and Europe, for use in Freevo
currently.

Installation:
==

To install XMLTV, a number of modules are required, for convenience,
here are some places to get the modules, "precompiled"

RPMS:
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/prerequisites/rpm/
http://www.funktronics.ca/openpvr/xmltvrpms/

Debian Packages:
deb http://freevo.sourceforge.net/debian unstable main

Grabbings listings:
==

Configure xmltv via the xmltv documented installation instructions.
For automatic downloading, you can add a line like this to your
crontab:
-
0 3 * * * /usr/bin/tv_grab_na --days=2 > /var/cache/xmltv/TV.xml
-

Use in Freevo:
==

Since XMLTV allows you to select the channels to grab at fetch-time,
the TV_CHANNELS directive in the config file is ignored.  To use the 
listings in freevo, set the following options in freevo_config

TV_GUIDE_METHOD = 'xmltv'
...
XMLTV_FILE = '/path/to/TV.xml'

Thanks
==
Much thanks to James Oakley of the openpvr project, who wrote the
Python XMLTV parsing module which is used extensively for XMLTV
support in Freevo.

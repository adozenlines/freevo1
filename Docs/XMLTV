XMLTV
-----

Abstract:
=========
Freevo can now use the XMLTV format (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/)
for TV listings. XMLTV downloads listings from a number of different
countries and regions into a standard XML based format. This is the
only way to get TV listings for Canada, and Europe, for use in Freevo
currently.

Also, if your listing provider supports it, you can use station cover logos
into the freevo interface. To download and prepare the cover logos for 
usage in freevo, all you need to do is run the makelogos.py program. Then,
the next time you go into the TV guide, you'll see all the stations logos.


Installation:
=============
XMLTV:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xmltv/xmltv-0.5.tar.gz?download

To install XMLTV, a number of modules are required, for convenience,
here are some places to get the modules, "precompiled":

RPMS:
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/prerequisites/rpm/
http://www.funktronics.ca/openpvr/xmltvrpms/

Debian Packages:
deb http://freevo.sourceforge.net/debian unstable main

The XMLTV README has instructions for using the Perl CPAN method 
of downloading and installing missing modules. 
Try using "force install <modulename>" if the regular install 
fails due to broken tests. The CPAN install process is quite
noisy, make sure to read all output to find the real problem
when a step fails.


Grabbing listings:
==================
Configure xmltv via the xmltv documented installation instructions.
For automatic downloading, you can add a line like this to your
crontab:
-
0 3 * * * /usr/bin/tv_grab_na --days=2 > /tmp/TV.xml
-

The Freevo module "epg_xmltv.py" can be run standalone to generate 
a translated version of the TV guide that makes the first startup 
a lot quicker.  XXX Add better instructions


Use in Freevo:
==============
Update the TV_CHANNELS variable in freevo_config.py. 

Please see that file for more detailed instructions!


Thanks
======
Much thanks to James Oakley of the openpvr project, who wrote the
Python XMLTV parsing module which is used extensively for XMLTV
support in Freevo.

Notes
-----
An upcoming release of Freevo will include support for multiple emulators,
as of right now, the following have been tested, and should work, however,
for optimum results, you need the following:

o libSDL-1.2.2 compiled against directfb >= 0.9.11

(DirectFB had the best results for SDL applications on a Television, in 
terms of raw speed, and image quality. To use it, make sure you have
the following environment variable defined as below:

export SDL_VIDEODRIVER="directfb"

In all cases, you need to run the binaries with the options to specify
"full screen" mode, otherwise you get the DirectFB mouse cursor on your
screen.

Emulators tested and "certified"
-----

o ScummVM >= 0.2.0

I'm using a later CVS build for Alsa support, but 0.2.0 or greater works
great on my television. The trick is also finding good fb modes. We'll
include a 640x480 and 640x400 modeline shortly.

All the LucasArts games I've tried worked excellently. A mouse is required
for all of them though.

o VisualBoy Advance

As this is only available as a binary, there is only the Linux-SDL build against
glibc 2.2. This worked perfectly as well, and supports joysticks, and nice video
filters.

This will allow you to play Gameboy Advance and Gameboy games.

o XMAME

I had to recompile this against libSDL as no binary was available, but it worked
well with directfb. I tried 0.60.1

Broken Emulators
----

o ZSNES

Crashed every time as it only supports 512x448 modes as of 1.35, and directfb will 
only work with 640x480. Could also not get it to work via fbcon without significant
artifacts and very low frame rate.

o Boycott Advance

Crashed right after initialization

If you've noticed that your G400 is a little too dark and seems to lack
colour, there is an easy fix which will make the TV Out much sharper, with
finer colour detail.

First, download this program:
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/maven-prog.tgz

Build and install as normal, and then run the following commands as
root:

matrox 0x1e 0xd0
matrox 0x20 0xff
matrox 0x22 0xff

This sets contrast, saturation, hue and brightness.

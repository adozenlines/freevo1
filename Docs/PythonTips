Some tips on how to use Python for Freevo
=========================================

Nothing here is mandatory. Some stuff is meant to as tips for stuff
that I've seen that people don't know about, other stuff is meant
to keep the code more consistent (while not being too fascist).

o Do not use names of builtin functions (IMPORTANT!):
  o dir, filter, str, file, etc

o Always use 4 spaces four indentation. Do not use tabs as 
  that can lead to errors if tabs and spaces are mixed in Python!

o Use tabnanny.py in the python lib to check for potential tab problems.
  Also use freevo/helpers/chktab.py!

o Use 'python -t -Wall::PendingDeprecationWarning main.py' to 
  check for potential problems.

o PyChecker TBD

o Strings: Use single-quotes in general (less visual clutter IMHO):
    'Some "doublequoted" text inside a string'
  Use double-quote if you want to use single-quotes inside:
    "I can't believe how easy Python is"
  Also use double-qoutes for multi-line string constants:
  """A multi-
     line
     comment.
  """

o Python's linebreak rules are not entirely straight-forward. 
  Most lines cannot be broken without a backslash (\). 
  The exception is for expressions with parenthesis and 
  braces (both kinds), Python doesn't need back-slashes there.
  I think it looks better with extra parenthesis instead of 
  backslashes.

o The builtin function "print" is very similar to printf() in C.
  The major difference is that it automatically adds a linefeed.
  \n, \r, \t etc can be used for extra spacing.
  A comma after the print statement prevents the linebreak:
    print 'test',
  It has all the regular %s, %d, %f etc, but usually only %s is
  needed since it will print any kind of variable after converting
  it to a string.

  1. Images for specific folders / movies

     1.1 Introduction

         Freevo supports small images in the movie and mp3 browser for
	 a folder and a movie file. The images in the movie browser
	 will be resized to 200x280 pixel (DVD cover, posters) and in
	 the mp3 browser to 200x200 pixel (CD cover). Freevo supports
	 jpg and png pictures for this images. The sizes can be
	 changed in the skin XML file (see 2.1)


     1.2 Folder images

         If there is a cover.png or cover.jpg in the folder, this file
	 will be the image for this folder in the parent directory.


     1.3 Movie images

	 You can drop an image file with the same basename as the
	 movie into the folder and this image will be used for this
	 movie. The same feature will be added for mp3 in the future. 

	 Example: movie.png will be used for movie.avi

	 There is also a generic way for images of tv shows.
	 Recordings for tv shows have a common name scheme. If you
	 drop an image with the name of the show into the tv show
	 image directory, this image will be taken. The name of the
	 image _must_ be lower case. You can specify a directory for
	 tv show images in freevo_config.py, the default is

	 TV_SHOW_IMAGES = "tv-show-images/"

	 Example: if you have tv-show-images/show.png, this image will
		  be used for "Show 2x10 - A cool episode.avi"


     1.4 xml files for movies

	 A more complex way is the XML support for movies. The XML
	 file is something like a link to a movie. The movie can be on
	 your harddisc, on cdrom or even a DVD or (S)VCD. The XML file
	 contains the title, the image and a list of files. You can
	 use imdb.py in freevos helpers directory to create these XML
	 files.

  2. Changing the skin file

     2.1 The default XML file

         Freevo uses python files to draw the skin. The main skin
         contains a XML file with attributes like color, font,
         positions etc. 

	 The file skins/xml/type1/768x576.xml contains the settings for
	 the current skin for 768x576 pixel resolutions. Currently
	 there is only support for the menu and mp3 player in the XML
	 file, the image viewer is unsupported right now.

	 WARNING: 
	 the XML file depends on the python skin. Other skins may have
	 different settings and this is a new feature and maybe some
	 things will change in the future.


     2.2 Changing the style for specific folders

	 You can have a per folder skin in freevo. The folder can
	 contain a skin.xml file with the same format as the
	 768x576.xml file. You can skip all nodes and attributes you
	 don't want to change.

	 Example: You have images or movies from your last vacation.
	 For this folder you want a specific background picture, let's
	 say a dark picture with sunset at the left side. You can now
	 change the font color to white so that you can read them,
	 move the menu to the right so that the sunset is visible all
	 the time. The title should be "Summer 2002" and not MOVIE
	 MENU or IMAGE MENU. When you move the menu to the right and
	 want to see the sunset all the time, you have no space left
	 for the small images mentioned above. So you disable
	 them. The blue selection doesn't fit the background colors,
	 so you change it to light grey.

	 The skin.xml file for this folder can look like this:

	 <?xml version="1.0" ?>
	 <freevo>
	   <skin>
	     <menu>
	       <bgbitmap>sunset.png</bgbitmap>
	       <title>
	         <font color="0xffffff"/>
		 <text>Summer 2002</text>
               </title>
	       <items x="260">
	 	 <font color="0xffffff">
	 	 <selection length="453" color="0xcccccc"/>
	       </items>
	       <cover>
	 	<movie visible="no"/>
	 	<image visible="no"/>
	       </cover>
	       <submenu>
	 	<selection color="0xcccccc"/>
	       </submenu>
	     </menu>
	   </skin>
	 </freevo>
	 

     2.3 CD-ROM support

	 Don't put a skin.xml file on a cd. The format may change. The
	 best way to customize a skin for a cd is a directory on your
	 harddisc with links or IMDB XML files. I'm working on a way
	 to associate a cd based on it's label to a skin.

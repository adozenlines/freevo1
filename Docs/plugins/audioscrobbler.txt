------------------------------------

Please mail me if you have strange problems or if you got everything up and running.
Want to keep track of the number of users to see if I should keep developing this plugin.

This is for the 2.5.x series of Freevo, might not work with all versions of Python and Freevo though.
Tested and reported to work with: Freevo 1.5.3 and Python 2.3

*** INSTALL ***

The only things you need for this plugin is three lines in the configuration file for Freevo.


plugin.activate('audioscrobbler')
AS_USER = 'username'
AS_PASSWORD = 'password'


There is one optional for debugging (spams alot, so I don't use the normal debug option).
AS_DEBUG = True 

No need to set it to False if you don't want to use it.

If you run into problems, *please* turn debug on and email all the info to me. Thanks.

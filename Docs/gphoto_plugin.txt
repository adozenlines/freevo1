Installation
------------
Make sure libgphoto2 is installed.

Copy pygphoto_lowlevel.py, _pygphoto_lowlevel.so and pygphoto.py to a place
where python can find it (e.g. /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages)

Copy gphoto.py to the image/plugins directory of your freevo installation.
(e.g.  /usr/share/pycentral/python-freevo/site-packages/freevo/image/plugins)

Add to your local_conf.py
| plugin.activate('image.gphoto')


Usage
-----
Plugin digicam in USB port (or whichever port it needs to be plugged in) (and
switch it on...)

Go to "Look at pictures". Wait up to 10 seconds. Then, there should be a new
entry now which you can just use like an ordinary directory.


Why?
----
Some digicams do not implement the usb-storage protocol
There is a gphotofs, but using this was far too slow.

This is a proposed layout for a FHB compliant release.

o Python scripts  - /usr/lib/freevo
o Boot Scripts    - /etc/init.d
o Config files    - /etc/freevo/
o XMLTV output    - /var/cache/freevo
o Skins		  - /usr/share/freevo/skins
o osd_server	  - /usr/sbin
o runapp	  - /usr/lib/freevo
o Docs		  - /usr/share/doc/freevo

This should be compliant will all Debian and FHB rules; 
as of today (June 17th) we only need to:

o modify boot/boot_config
o modify boot/freevo
o modify freevo_config
o modify childapp.py for runapp

The matrox_g400 stuff should probably not go onto a FHB
system since the stuff in it is provided elsewhere.

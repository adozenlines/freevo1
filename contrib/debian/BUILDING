If you want to build your own package, you need to move this 'debian/' 
folder into the root of the freevo source package. There, you can run
debbuild as usual.

Currently, there are some things missing:

1. No configuration is placed anywhere; you'll need to make /etc/freevo
and put stuff there.
2. No init.d script, though the one in the boot/ directory works nicely
on my system

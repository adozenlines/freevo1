I just finished my xmltv listing-grabber for Sweden and Norway.. It grabs the 
listings from http://www.dagenstv.com ...

I've submitted it to Ed (xmltv author), but here it is anyway if there are any 
of you who want it! ;-)

Usage:  dagenstv2xmltv <days> <lang> <filename>
where days = number of days to fetch, lang = sv for swedish and no for 
norvegian, filename = output filename :)

Installation notes for freevused midlet
---------------------------------------

Upload the .jar and .jad files to the phone.

In the install section of the Makefile is an example of what I use.
I just copy the files to a machine that has bluetooth access and I upload
the .jar to the phone with gammu[1]

About the binary provided
-------------------------

The compilation of this midlet has been only tested with a Nokia 6230 phone.
I have used the j2me classes provided with an SDK from Nokia but the midlet
has no Nokia especific code.
It could work with other phones but I don't have any way to test it.

If there is someone that knows better about j2me and can provide a better
method to compile the midlet I will apreciate it very much.

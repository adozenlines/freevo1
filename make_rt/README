Creating the Freevo runtime
===========================

This directory contains a utility to create a runtime for Freevo so that
it can run on any Linux distribution. 

It uses the Installer utility that can analyze a Python program and 
generate an executable that contains the python interpreter along
with all Python source. All dynamic link libraries are also included.

Installer is run on freevo_rt.py, which is just a tiny program that
includes all Python system libs (see modlist.py), as well as 
all Freevo dependencies such as PyGame, PIL, etc. The generated 
executable is freevo_rt, that will run an external Python application at
startup. 

The Freevo source is not part of the freevo_rt executable, since it 
is supposed to be separately distributed from the runtime which will
hopefully not change very often.

Release Notes for 1.5.0 (2004-07-17)
------------------------------------

This release is stable, but there are some plugins know to cause
problems. For a crash-free usage, you shouldn't activate them.

The cvs will be in code freeze for another week. After that, we start
developing again and it's hard to make an update release. So if you
find a bug or update a translation file, do so until 2004-07-24. We
will release 1.5.1 if necessary then.

For a complete changelog, read the ChangLog file.


Plugins with problems:
----------------------

video.mplayer-vis:
There seems to be a problem in pygoom resulting in a pygame segfault. 

video.bmovl:
This plugin is experimental, it may crash

video.details:
It won't crash Freevo, but maybe it doesn't work as expected

Release Notes for 1.7.7
-----------------------

Changes include the renaming of configuration variables, to correct these
do the following:

freevo convert_config /etc/freevo/local_config
freevo convert_config /etc/freevo/local_config -w


While the changes to favorites have been back ported from the rel-1 branch,
they are currently disabled, if you would like to try the favorites pickle file
you can do this by uncommenting (remove the '#') on line 58 in
tv/record_types.py.

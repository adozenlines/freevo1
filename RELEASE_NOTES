Release Notes for 1.8.0
=======================

In this release Twisted has been removed from the recordserver and now we use
kaa.rpc. kaa.rpc is faster than Twisted's xml-rpc calls and so the TV guide is
more responsive.


A significant change to the TV recording has been the replacement of the
record_schedule.xml with two files, schedule.pickle and favorites.pickle. This
means that unless the record_schedule.xml has been saved to a safe place during
the installation then you will lose you favorites.

To convert the favorites to the new format do the following:

cp /var/lib/freevo/record_schedule.xml ~ (or cp ~/.freevo/lib/record_schedule.xml ~)
freevo recordserver stop
freevo convert_favorites ~/record_schedule.xml
freevo schedulefavorites
freevo recordserver start


Other changes include the renaming of configuration variables, to correct these
do the following:

freevo convert_config /etc/freevo/local_config
freevo convert_config /etc/freevo/local_config -w

Release Notes for 1.6.0
-----------------------

The have been quite a number of changes, see ChangeLog for details.
The ChangeLog has a tracker reference for a discussion about the
changes.

IMPORTANT
---------

The recordable setting has been from from VIDEO_GROUPS
Delete this setting from your local_conf.py

This change can be mostly automated by running:
freevo convert_config

To use multi-tuner support the VIDEO_GROUPS needs setting up correctly
see http://freevo.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/doc/MultiTunerConfig

elementtree, include in Python-2.5+, is now a prerequisite for freevo,
if can be downloaded from http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree.htm

Known Problems
--------------

If a directory is name with a media extension it will be treated as a
media file, e.g. music.mp3 or record.avi.

If webradio is activated it will appear twice in the music menu.

If a mp3 file is incorrectly named the header search will scan the whole
file, e.g. something.mp3 which is really a wave file.

Sometime the headlines plug-in crashed when it receives incorrect data
from the rss feed.


Release Notes for 1.5.3
-----------------------

This release is stable, but there are some plugins know to cause
problems. For a crash-free usage, you shouldn't activate them.



Plugins with problems:
----------------------

video.mplayer-vis:
There seems to be a problem in pygoom resulting in a pygame segfault. 

video.bmovl:
This plugin is experimental, it may crash

video.details:
It won't crash Freevo, but maybe it doesn't work as expected

This directory conatins the xml files for the main1 skin. 

blue1_big_800x600 and grey1_800x600 conatin all needed information for
a skin. All other skins inherit for one of these. 

|  IMPORTANT:
|  
|  the xml files are for the main1 skin, the fxd files for the new
|  dischi1 skin.

Developers: if you update/add some global stuff, please update these
skins to auto-update all others skins. If you want to update a
specific xml skin, please make the updates to the 800x600 version, the
other resolutions inherit from these and will scale down all
values. The smaller resolutions contain mostly information about a
background image. There are some test files where there is no 800x600
version, change the 768x576 skin here.

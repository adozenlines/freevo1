add indicators for tv items

fallback to text view if all images are the same

Some tag names are the same as in the movie definitions. I will
change the area names from e.g. title to titlearea to have _one_
clean DTD for all our xml files.

No "this directory is empty" handling yet (you only see nothing)

blue1_round will get an image listing, too

Finish integration of Robs new gui stuff

Add force-to-style and begin-with style in some way

better scroll up/down handling for text menus

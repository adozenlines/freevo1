fallback to text view if all images are the same

Some tag names are the same as in the movie definitions. I will
change the area names from e.g. title to titlearea to have _one_
clean DTD for all our xml files.

blue1_round will get an image listing, too

Finish integration of Robs new gui stuff

integrate the idle bar (position, colors, visible=yes/no)

better handling of tv shows (strip show name if all items are from 
the same show)

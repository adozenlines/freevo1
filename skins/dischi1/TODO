no indicators for tv items and UP/DOWN for more items than you see

DISPLAY can only toggle between two styles

No fallback to text view if all images are the same

No grey skin

Some tag names are the same as in the movie definitions. I will
change the area names from e.g. title to titlearea to have _one_
clean DTD for all our xml files.

The skin.xml files will be renamed to folder.fxd

All skins will be renamed from xml to fxd

No "this directory is empty" handling yet (you only see nothing)

blue1_round will get an image listing, too

Finish integration of Robs new gui stuff

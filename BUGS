o The osd_x11 server doesn't redraw automatically when moving other windows over it.
o The EPG (electronic program guide = TV programs) has misaligned columns.
o The menu headings are not centered.
o The EPG should be reloaded automatically to allow program end/start
o Remote command events cannot be handled fast enough, e.g. when scrolling
  through menu items.
o There are some problems with some of the included fonts when linked against 
  libfreetype >= 2.1.1; 2.0.9 is recommended for now.

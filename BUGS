Known bugs for the Freevo project
---------------------------------

$Id$


o The EPG should be reloaded automatically to allow program end/start
o Remote command events cannot be handled fast enough, e.g. when scrolling
  through menu items.
o There are some problems with some of the included fonts when linked against 
  libfreetype >= 2.1.1; 2.0.9 is recommended for now.
  o The runtime contains a version of libfreetype known to work.
o Left/Right does not goto prev/next movie. It works for music.
o Mount checking does not work with supermount
o Identifymedia fails on some drives (still? report to dmeyer@tzi.de please)
o Freevo fails on drives that are not valid devices for freevo_config.ROM_DRIVES
o The menus do not have the same number of files per page.
o Some Python modules like PyXMMS, OGG are missing from the 
  runtime.
o DVD number of titles returns 100 (default) for some disks, why?
o osd.py doesn't work with X11 (probably FB too) if the screen depth isn't 32:
    "icon = pygame.image.load('icons/freevo_app.png').convert()"
  raises an exception. Can probably be fixed by changing the PyGame init to 
  allow other settings than 32 bits.

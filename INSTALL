Installation instructions for Freevo
------------------------------------

$Id$


o Recompile the Linux kernel (>=2.4.13). It is assumed that all options 
  are compiled in statically. If they're compiled as modules instead you
  have to make sure that they're loaded before Freevo.

o Test the video4linux driver using xawtv
  o Freevo uses its' own tables for channels

o Compile and install all the programs in apps/
  o Install XviD
  o Install MPlayer
    o Test with the MGA graphics driver
  o Install NVrec
    o Test recording to a file
  o Install lirc
    o Test:
      o Insert the serial driver module
      o Start the daemon

o Compile Freevo
  o Requires freetype 2.x, libpng
  o Requires Python >= version 2.1 (1.5 OK?)
  o Test the remote using the lirc application irw, and using the 
    remote_control_lirc.py Freevo application
  o Test the text OSD test driver
  o Test the MGA G400 OSD framebuffer driver

o Test matrox_g400/v4l1_to_mga  (Video4Linux1 -> Framebuffer)
  o It _must_ be used with the matrox_g400/mga_vid.o module,
    not the one from MPlayer.
  o Check out the source for how to set the input, norm, channel

o Update the settings in config.py!
  o TV_SETTINGS, VCR_SETTINGS, TV_CHANNELS depending on where you live.
  o DIR_MP3, DIR_MOVIES, DIR_RECORD for where your files are
  o EPG_URL if you want to use the Electronic Program Guide.

o Test Freevo using the simulated OSD and remote, just start "freevo"
  in the main directory

o Run Freevo using the real OSD framebuffer driver and the lirc remote

o Create a boot-script that will start Freevo when Linux is booting.
  boot/boot_freevo1 is a good start, it boots up my computer that
  has a Matrox G400 dual-head graphics adapter and a lirc-compatible 
  IR receiver on /dev/ttyS0.
  o Make sure that X11 doesn't start up by changing the default 
    runlevel in /etc/inittab to 3

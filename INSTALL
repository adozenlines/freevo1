------------------------------------

o Recompile the Linux kernel (>=2.4.13). It is assumed that all options 
  are compiled in statically. If they're compiled as modules instead you
  have to make sure that they're loaded before Freevo.

o Test the video4linux driver using xawtv
  o Freevo uses its' own tables for channels

o Compile and install all the programs in apps/
  o Install XviD
  o Install MPlayer
    o Test with the MGA graphics driver
  o Install mpg321 (or alternately, mpg123)
    o Test audio output with an mp3
  o Install NVrec
    o Test recording to a file
  o Install lirc
    o Test:
      o Insert the serial driver module
      o Start the daemon

    o http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.1/Python-2.2.1.tgz
  o Optionally install Python Imaging Library for cover art.
  o Test the remote using the lirc application irw, and using the 
    remote_control_lirc.py Freevo application
  o Test the text OSD test driver
  o Test the MGA G400 OSD framebuffer driver

o Test matrox_g400/v4l1_to_mga  (Video4Linux1 -> Framebuffer)
  o It _must_ be used with the matrox_g400/mga_vid.o module,
    not the one from MPlayer.
  o Check out the source for how to set the input, norm, channel

o Update the settings in config.py!
  o TV_SETTINGS, VCR_SETTINGS, TV_CHANNELS depending on where you live.
  o DIR_MP3, DIR_MOVIES, DIR_RECORD for where your files are

o Two TV Guide method are currently supported
  o Define TV_GUIDE_METHOD to 'yahoo' or 'xmltv' 

o XMLTV Method
  o See Docs/XMLTV for usage instructions

o Yahoo Method
  o Set the EPG_URL and TV_CHANNELS variable to use Yahoo TV listings. (U.S. Only!)

o Test Freevo using the simulated OSD and remote, just start "freevo"
  in the main directory

o Run Freevo using the real OSD framebuffer driver and the lirc remote

o Create a boot-script that will start Freevo when Linux is booting.
  boot/freevo is a good start.
  o Make sure that X11 doesn't start up by changing the default 
    runlevel in /etc/inittab to 3
  o boot/freevo needs to have boot/boot_config placed in /etc/freevo
  o boot/freevo_dep contains code to load lirc, mga_vid, etc. This must
    be done before freevo is started, but can be done in other ways than
    using the freevo_dep script.

Installation instructions for Freevo
------------------------------------

$Id$


Detailed help is in the Freevo WiKi at
http://freevo.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/DocumentationPage


Short description:
------------------

You can either use the full binary package or the source
distribution. The full binary versions conatins all needed
dependencies for Freevo, except external programs like mplayer and
xine. But this version may not work on all distributions. So you could
install Freevo and all dependencies into your system.

To install Freevo, run 'python setup.py install' as root. If you don't
want to install freevo, you can also start freevo directly in the
unpacked tarball. It is not possible to install the full binary
version of Freevo into the system.



Dependencies:
-------------

Freevo has many dependencies. Based on your distribution, it's more or
less easy to install everything.


o Redhat 9 (and maybe other RPM based distributions)

  There is a list of needed RPMs to install Freevo in
  contrib/rpm/freevo-deps.txt.



o Gentoo:

  You need to update your portage tree with some missing packages. Get
  rsync-freevo at http://freevo.sourceforge.net/gentoo/rsync-freevo
  and start it. You should get a freevo ebuild. Now you can run
  'emerge freevo' to install Freevo.



o Debian:

  A Debian apt source is available and includes all the dependencies
  you'll need.
  You should add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

  deb http://freevo.sourceforge.net/debian unstable main
  deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main

  (The second source provides mplayer and other multimedia packages)

  Then, simply run apt-get update && apt-get install freevo to fetch
  all the dependencies you'll require to run Freevo.

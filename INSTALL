Installation instructions for Freevo
------------------------------------

$Id$


WARNING: The framebuffer code can render the console unusuable if set up
         incorrectly! Do not attempt if you cannot login from another
         computer on the network!


Quickstart (X11 version)
------------------------
o Download Freevo, preferably from CVS, un-tar
o Download and install the following dependencies (see below for details):
  o freetype2, libpng, libz, Python >=2.1, PyXML, Python Image Library
o Update freevo_config.py to suit your system (optional)
o This will check the dependencies and make the X11 version:
  o ./configure --osd=x11 ; make
o Run Freevo:
  o ./freevo
  o You must use the remote control xterm window for keyboard input!


Detailed instructions
---------------------

Some of these steps are optional, a minimal Freevo system can be set up
that doesn't require TV-out, framebuffer, Video4Linux or lirc. It will
still be useful to play movies/mp3's under X11.


o Recompile the Linux kernel (>=2.4.13). It is assumed that all options 
  are compiled in statically. If they're compiled as modules instead you
  have to make sure that they're loaded before Freevo.
  o This step is not needed until you need the Video4Linux and/or TV-out.

o Test the video4linux driver using xawtv (optional)
  o Freevo uses its' own tables for channels

o Compile and install the needed external apps. MPlayer and mpg321/mpg123
  are needed for the core Video/Audio playback functionality, the others
  can be installed as needed.
  o Install MPlayer
    o Test with the MGA graphics driver
  o Install mpg321 (or alternately, mpg123)
    o Test audio output with an mp3
  o Install NVrec
    o Test recording to a file
  o Install lirc
    o Test:
      o Insert the serial driver module
      o Start the daemon

o Compile Freevo
  o ./configure --osd=fb ; make
    o Use "./configure --help" for more information
  o Requires freetype 2 (2.0.9 is preferred for now)
    o http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/freetype/freetype-2.0.9.tar.gz?download
  o Requires libpng
    o http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.2.3.tar.gz?download
  o Requires libz (already installed on most Linux distros)
    o http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz?download
  o Requires Python >= version 2.1 (We've had reports of problems with 1.5.x)
    o http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.1/Python-2.2.1.tgz
  o Requires PyXML (Tested with 0.7.1)
    o http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/pyxml/PyXML-0.7.1.tar.gz
      o tar xvzf PyXML-0.7.1.tar.gz
      o cd PyXML-0.7.1
      o python setup.py build
      o (as root): python setup.py install
  o PIL, Python Imaging Library (Tested with 1.1.3)
    o http://www.pythonware.com/downloads/Imaging-1.1.3.tar.gz
      o Installation should use the following method, not from the BUILDME:
      o tar xvzf Imaging-1.1.3.tar.gz
      o cd Imaging-1.1.3/libImaging
      o ./configure
      o make
      o cd ..
      o python setup.py build
      o (as root): python setup.py install
  o Test the remote using the lirc application irw, and using the 
    remote_control_lirc.py Freevo application (optional)
  o Test the X11 OSD test driver
  o Test the MGA G400 OSD framebuffer driver (optional)

o Test matrox_g400/v4l1_to_mga  (Video4Linux1 -> Framebuffer, optional)
  o It _must_ be used with the matrox_g400/mga_vid.o module,
    not the one from MPlayer.
  o Check out the source for how to set the input, norm, channel

o Update the settings in config.py!
  o TV_SETTINGS, VCR_SETTINGS, TV_CHANNELS depending on where you live.
  o DIR_MP3, DIR_MOVIES, DIR_RECORD for where your files are

o XMLTV method for download TV listings
  o See Docs/XMLTV for usage instructions

o Test Freevo using the X11 OSD and remote, just start "freevo"
  in the main directory

o Run Freevo using the framebuffer OSD driver and the lirc remote (optional)

o Create a boot-script that will start Freevo when Linux is booting. (optional)
  boot/freevo is a good start.
  o Make sure that X11 doesn't start up by changing the default 
    runlevel in /etc/inittab to 3
  o boot/freevo needs to have boot/boot_config placed in /etc/freevo
  o boot/freevo_dep contains code to load lirc, mga_vid, etc. This must
    be done before freevo is started, but can be done in other ways than
    using the freevo_dep script.


Kernel configuration
--------------------

Use this for configuration of a kernel with Video4Linux+G400 support. You
probably have to add support for your particular Video4Linux device as 
well.

--- KERNEL CONFIG ---

  [Y] Video For Linux
  Video For Linux --->
    [Y] V4L information in proc filesystem

Console drivers --->
  [Y] VGA text console
  [Y/M] MDA text console (dual-headed)
  Frame-buffer support --->
    [Y] Support for frame buffer devices

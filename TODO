Todo list for Freevo
====================

$Id$


Short-term
----------
o Check that the applications exist in startup.py, now it will
  just loop forever trying to start them
o Add rcs id to all files!
o Channel guide layout
o Add view related bitmap to mp3/movie lists/playing
  Paul Aubin:
  Put a .jpg file in the directory called cover.jpg,
  and for the movies, a movie_filename.jpg and show the cover art.
o A switch to turn off the EPG altogether if no listings are available.
o Make the EPG handling more modular
o Add xmltv to the EPG
o Use alsaplayer instead of mpg123
o Installation instructions, clean up config stuff
  Paul Aubin:
  2) The lirc stuff is tricky. I'm used to an lircrc file, as I imagine
     most people are. It wasn't terribly difficult, in all fairness, just
     took a little getting used to.
  4) Lots of hard coded things within the application root that probably
     don't need to be there (fbset, matroxset)
  5) Add debian packaging
o Proper logging to a file of errors and debug info
o Use btaudio for audio recording from the video card
o Add page numbers to the menus, i.e. "Page 3/14"
o Select packages for release (mplayer, xvid, nvrec, ffmpeg)
o clean up Docs/Notes
o Add basic DVD navigation (titles, chapters, languages, subtitles)
o Play audio CD-roms
o Add DVD backups
  o mencoder works fine with XviD/FFMPEG, but it cannot be started from Freevo yet
o Add a digital filter to remove 50/60 Hz line-noise from audio line input
  o Is only a problem for connecting line in to a VCR?
o Finish LICENSE
o Website:
  o Add an animated GIF of the system being used instead?
  o New favicon
 

Mid-term
--------
o Adjustment of saturation, contrast, etc for both TV-in and
  TV-out.
  o Have a menu choice to save the settings to a config file
o Picture-In-Picture, channelscan
  o Both using one or two WinTV boards
  o Rewrite the TV app to use framegrabbing instead of overlay
o Change channel during recording
o Display error messages from mplayer when a movie/dvd cannot be played  
o View photo galleries
o Add support for mjpeg recording of video for off-line compression
  o Could also be used to watch the recorded piece in real-time as it 
    is being recorded
o Use getop for python argument parsing
o MP3 playing:
  o Have a play queue that files can be added to/removed from while the
    MP3 player is playing from it. 
  o Random playing
  o Select several playlists and AND or OR them together.
o Bugzilla


Long-term
---------
o Radio in, record to MP3
o email and ICQ notifs
o ir out to control a cable box, satellite receiver, etc
o recording schedule
o text-to-speech for menus, notifications
o MAME, other emulators
o Mate blursk with FB and mpg123
o Rate shows and get recommendations on other shows
o Control and receive video data from a network TV tuner daemon


Ideas
-----
o Voice recognition -> sub-titles, at least phonetic text
o Chat with others watching the same show

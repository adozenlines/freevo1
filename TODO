Todo list for Freevo
====================

$Id$


Short-term
----------
o Add rcs id to all files!
o Channel guide layout
o Installation instructions, clean up config stuff
  Paul Aubin:
  1) A lot of the python paths are hardcoded. I s'//'-ed through and fixed
     them; though that's mostly because Debian puts python in /usr/bin
  2) The lirc stuff is tricky. I'm used to an lircrc file, as I imagine
     most people are. It wasn't terribly difficult, in all fairness, just
     took a little getting used to.
  3) The boot script does more than it needs to :) mga_vid, lirc are
     both their own "thing" so it might make sense to leave them in
     /etc/modules or at least keep them something like this:
     --
     if grep -q '^mga_vid$' /etc/modules; then
      /sbin/modprobe mga_vid || echo "Could not initialize Matrox BES"
     fi
     --

     A similar approach to check for a running lircd might be good too. 

   4) Lots of hard coded things within the application root that probably
     don't need to be there (fbset, matroxset)

o Select packages for release (mplayer, xvid, nvrec, ffmpeg)
o clean up Notes
o Add DVD rip
  o mencoder works fine with XviD/FFMPEG, but it cannot be started from Freevo yet
o Add a digital filter to remove 50/60 Hz line-noise from audio line input
  o Is only a problem for connecting line in to a VCR?
o Finish LICENSE
  o Add a copyright string to all files
o Website:
  o Add an animated GIF of the system being used instead of the 13MB DivX?
  o Add links to the mailing list
  o Make a sidebar with quick links
 

Mid-term
--------
o Adjustment of saturation, contrast, etc for both TV-in and
  TV-out.
  o Have a menu choice to save the settings to a config file
o Website:
  o Logo
  o Design, graphics. Can copy some stuff from winehq
o Picture-In-Picture, channelscan
  o Both using one or two WinTV boards
  o Rewrite the TV app to use framegrabbing instead of overlay
o Change channel during recording
o Display error messages from mplayer when a movie/dvd cannot be played  
o View photo galleries
o Add support for mjpeg recording of video for off-line compression
  o Could also be used to watch the recorded piece in real-time as it 
    is being recorded
o Use getop for python argument parsing


Long-term
---------
o Radio in, record to MP3
o email and ICQ notifs
o ir out to control a cable box, satellite receiver, etc
o recording schedule
o text-to-speech for menus, notifications
o MAME, other emulators
o Mate blursk with FB and mpg123
o Rate shows and get recommendations on other shows


Ideas
-----
o Voice recognition -> sub-titles, at least phonetic text
o Chat with others watching the same show

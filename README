Freevo is a Linux application that turns a PC with a TV capture card
and/or TV-out into a standalone multimedia jukebox/VCR. It builds on
other applications such as MPlayer to play and
record video and audio.

Please follow the instructions on the Freevo website! There are more
docs on the Freevo website in a WiKi and in the mailing list archive.

If you have questions, please join the Freevo users mailing list. You
can also send patches, bugreports, docs, plugins, skins and
translations to this list.

* Bugreports. Please send them to the Freevo mailing list.

* Docs. Some plugins are badly documented. If you have some free time,
  please send a small description how to activate and configure the
  plugin. Again, to the freevo user list

* Translations. Freevo now has i18n support. Please send us
  translations are corrections in the current translation. (?)

* Patches. If you find a bug and can fix it, send it to the list with
  the subject [PATCH].

  can't break anything when it's not active, we will include any
  (useful) plugin in the Freevo SVN (indentifier [PLUGIN]

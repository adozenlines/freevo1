Freevo

$Id$


Freevo is a Linux application that turns a PC with a TV capture card
and/or TV-out into a standalone multimedia jukebox/VCR. It builds on
other applications such as mplayer, and NVRec to play and
record video and audio.


Overview
========

Sub-directories:
----------------
osd_server/             Contains the Linux framebuffer OSD server,
						X11 server, and SDL server.
rc_server/              Contains the lirc remote control client,
                        and the simulated remote control client
matrox_g400/            Contains things that are specific to the 
                        Matrox G400 graphics card. Might work for 
                        other cards such as G450, but that is 
                        untested.
boot/                   Contains files that are unique for the
                        user's machine, e.g. start scripts.
helpers/				Standalone utils that grab album covers
						from the web, imdb data.
icons/					Some icon files for the main menu

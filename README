Freevo is a Linux application that turns a PC with a TV capture card
and/or TV-out into a standalone multimedia jukebox/VCR. It builds on
other applications such as mplayer, and NVRec to play and
record video and audio.

                        framebuffer console or the Matrox G400
                        graphics card. Might work for other cards such
                        as G450, but that is untested.

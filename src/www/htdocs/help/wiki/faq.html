<p><a name="head-40daf628f497eb206255c0dab19fcc4cfa229b42"></a><H1>1 I downloaded Freevo and tried running it, but it crashes with [some exception]. What version of Python does Freevo require?</H1>

<p>As of Freevo 1.5, the recommended python version is Python 2.3 for providing 
proper Unicode (non-English language) support. However, presently (June 19, 2004)  
the freevo-runtime 0.3.1 is still based on python 2.2, so instead of using freevo-runtime, 
you'll need to install all system dependencies in addition to having a system-installed freevo  
in order for it to work properly. 
<p>WARNING: Don't mix a freevo-runtime based installation with the system-installation method, it'll 
probably result in unexpected errors. 
<p>For earlier versions of freevo (1.4.x), try using the freevo-runtime instead.  
Development and testing was done using that. Report the problem if it still occurs. 
<p>To run Freevo 1.4.x without the runtime you need Python 2.2 with a number 
of additional libraries installed. Just use the runtime unless you 
want to spend a significant amount of time installing and patching 
stuff. There's some docs (INSTALL.deps) about doing it, but we put 
together the runtime just so that people wouldn't have to struggle 
with it (and us spending too much time answering the same questions 
over and over)... 
<p><a name="head-823c5c50a70d998350c122471471126caa1c0a05"></a><H1>2 I'm getting an error when trying to run Freevo. It says: "ImportError: No module named utils"</H1>

<p>You're missing a required library that is required by Freevo. 
<p>You need to install Python XML. You should either get the package for your 
distribution or fetch the upstream version and build it yourself. 
<p>You can get it from: 
<a class="external" href="http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/"><img src="/wiki/img/moin-www.gif" width="11" border="0" alt="[WWW]" hspace="4" height="11">http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/</a> 
<p><a name="head-c9227ded8132c77920d8769de99d74ef46f61e15"></a><H1>3 I'm getting an error when trying to run Freevo. It says: "ImportError: No module named pygame.locals"</H1>

<p>You're missing a library required for Freevo. Despite it's name, pygame isn't just for games but provides an 
interface to the SDL layer which Freevo uses to draw the interface. You should either get the package for your 
distribution or fetch the upstream version and build it yourself. 
<p>You can get it from: 
<a class="external" href="http://www.pygame.org"><img src="/wiki/img/moin-www.gif" width="11" border="0" alt="[WWW]" hspace="4" height="11">http://www.pygame.org</a> 
<p><a name="head-a040f46c2782c4719bed2868c18929ec8f7ca0db"></a><H1>4 How do I play (S)VCDs?</H1>

<p>Make sure local_conf.py is properly setup (MPLAYER_ARGS_VCD). 
Test the same commandline from the shell to make sure it can be 
played. Use "VCD" in Freevo to play it. You need to use the 
Freevo function for opening and closing the tray to mount the 
disk. 
<p><a name="head-5e45aec0b972ef0de3e2c97dab8b3e1907941f22"></a><H1>5 How do I play CD audio disks?</H1>

<p>Freevo should autodetect your CD devices depending on the structure of your /etc/fstab. 
If it doesn't find one, add an entry like this to your local_conf. 
<p><tt class="wiki">&#160;ROM_DRIVES&#160;=&#160;[&#160;('/mnt/cdrom','/dev/cdrom','CD')]&#160;</tt> 
<p>If you have problems with stuttering audio, make sure you have your hdparm settings set up correctly. 
I had to do the following to get acceptable audio playing on my machine: 
<p><tt class="wiki">&#160;hdparm&#160;-d1&#160;-a8&#160;-u1&#160;-c1&#160;/dev/cdrom&#160;</tt> 
<p><a name="head-d0dc52bd5717f8cfe374c3d4d3f49e4579a560f0"></a><H1>6 When I insert a DVD Freevo doesn't recognize / can't play it</H1>

<p>In freevo config, your ROM_DRIVES setting will look something like: 
<p><tt class="wiki">&#160;ROM_DRIVES&#160;=&#160;[&#160;('/mnt/dvd',&#160;'/dev/hdc',&#160;'DVD')&#160;]&#160;</tt>} 
<p>Thats 'mountpoint', 'device name', 'what we call it'.  In order for freevo to recognize the dvd it mounts it, looks at the files on it, then unmounts it.  It uses the mountpoint that you tell it in ROM_DRIVES to do this. 
<p>From the shell type: <tt class="wiki">&#160;mount&#160;/mnt/dvd&#160;</tt>} 
<p>now ls /mnt/dvd (if the mount was successful).  If you see files there you are halfway there.  If the mount failed then you need to setup your /etc/fstab to have an entry for your dvd drive, like: 
<p><tt class="wiki">&#160;/dev/hdc&#160;&#160;&#160;/mnt/dvd&#160;&#160;iso9660&#160;&#160;defaults,user,noauto,ro&#160;&#160;0&#160;&#160;0&#160;</tt> 
<p>Ok, unmount it, umount /mnt/dvd. 
<p>Now before you try to play the dvd in freevo make sure you can play it with your copy of mplayer. Do: "mplayer dvd://" ("mplayer -dvd 1" in older versions) if that worked you 
are almost there.  If it didn't work then you may need to build your own mplayer binary or download an rpm from somewhere, you need dvd support. 
<p>Try all this stuff first, and if that works hopefully you can play your dvd from freevo. 
<p>If all of this fails, try creating the file freevo-rebuild-database in your Freevo cache directory. On Debian, the command: <tt class="wiki">&#160;touch&#160;/var/cache/freevo/freevo-rebuild-database&#160;</tt> should work, if run with sufficient privileges. 
<p><a name="head-cebbfda9ef70d98d71bba2d0f82a3a44be6360c7"></a><H1>7 I have an old computer with a processor less than 400 Mhz, will it be able to do all functions in Freevo?</H1>

<p>No. The core application will work on slower machines, as well 
as image viewing and MP3 playback. But video/DVD playback and 
recording requires around 400 MHz, and simultaneous 
video record and playback requires an even faster machine, 
especially for higher resolutions. We'd recommend 
something over 1 Ghz if you want to use that feature when it comes 
out (based on the hardware needs of mythtv). If you only want video 
playback, less than 400 Mhz may be enough, please check the mplayer 
doc about this (<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/">http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/</a>). 
<p><a name="head-1752e45a066fe78c7e94dde0df73fabdffb42518"></a><H1>8 I'm using distribution X will that work with freevo?</H1>

<p>Most distributions should work with freevo. The freevo_runtime and freevo_apps 
packages contains all the external dependencies for Freevo (Python, SDL, 
Freetype, MPlayer, etc). You might have to get a different version of MPlayer 
depending on your system (for instance, the freevo_apps MPlayer doesn't support 
Alsa). 
<p>Freevo is distributed both as RPMs and ".tar.gz" files. <b>The RPMs do not always 
work on all systems</b>, so please try the ".tar.gz" files before asking for help on the 
mailing list. The main webpage and the Wiki <a href="/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/DocumentationPage">DocumentationPage</a> documents how to do the installation. 
<p><a name="head-c1a8bb884e769dab2565819e9f5ea69c95a426b9"></a><H1>9 I'm running Freevo on a Matrox G400 in framebuffer mode. Why is the screen "squeezed together" horizontally. I have black bars about 1" (3 cm) on either side of the TV screen!</H1>

<p>The SDL library that Freevo uses resets the framebuffer settings. 
This is fixed by re-running the "fbset" command, which is done 
using the scripts in matrox_g400/mga_[ntsc|pal]_*. There is an 
option to run a script like this automatically after startup, see 
OSD_SDL_EXEC_AFTER_STARTUP in local_conf.py. 
<p><a name="head-22daa7e70230670b3d075e1c9b6a14ac0a747bee"></a><H1>10 If I watch a movie that has a different aspect ratio than the TV/monitor (i.e. is letter-boxed, e.g. 16:9), the movie is displayed at the top of the screen. In other words, it is not vertically centered.</H1>

<p>This is a known problem with the X11/Xv display in MPlayer, 
hopefully this will be fixed later.  UPDATE: This info is misleading, or perhaps just outdated.  In the local_conf.py file (/usr/local/freevo/local_conf.py) change the option from MPLAYER_USE_WID = 1   to   MPLAYER_USE_WID = 0    that should fix the problem.  I don't know the advantage for using window mode, but disabling it fixes the "window at the top" problem. 
<p><a name="head-cb6121390e7b8dea366075a5885534324ca94298"></a><H1>11 /dev/dsp doesn't work under KDE, it complains that the sound device is busy.</H1>

<p>Try setting AUDIO_DEVICE in local_conf.py to '/dev/dsp1' instead. 
You may also find that /dev/dsp is being used by artsdsp (you can find out by typing "fuser -v /dev/dsp", assuming you have fuser installed in your distro). If this is the case, then type "killall -9 artsdsp" and then try running freevo. If freevo then works, then you can choose to either no longer use arts, or see if one of the other sound devices might work for you instead eg "ls /dev/ds*". If you're lucky, your sound card might be able to use a digital interface to talk to the video capture card - you can find out which by typing "dmesg|grep dsp" - note that even if you do see a digital device, it might not work with your sound card.

<p>The Hauppauge WinTV works great,  at least

This description applies to freevo version &gt;1.3.2 (full release) To make mplayer skip 10 minutes forward and backward in a movie for example we have to modify local_conf.py: 
<pre class="code">
EVENTS['video']['PREV'] = Event(VIDEO_SEND_MPLAYER_CMD, arg='seek -600') 
EVENTS['video']['NEXT'] = Event(VIDEO_SEND_MPLAYER_CMD, arg='seek 600') 
 
</pre> 
That way we let freevo know what to send to mplayer to do what we want and assign the commands to the names PREV and NEXT. Now, we need to modify /etc/freevo/lircrc to use the commands PREV and NEXT. Example: 
<pre class="code">
begin 
    prog = freevo 
    button = 7 
    config = PREV 
end 
begin 
    prog = freevo 
    button = 9 
    config = NEXT 
end 
</pre> 
With these two sections we assign the buttons "7" to skip 10 minutes backward and "9" to skip 10 minutes forward. 
<p><a href="http://mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/documentation.html#commands">http://mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/documentation.html#commands</a> is a list of the commands mplayer supports. You can use these to make further customizations or get detailed descriptions.

<p>The Linux kernel has a built in screen blanking routine, which is enabled by default. You can disable the kernel's blanking by using the 
'setterm' application. Freevo also includes a script called 'blanking' in the helpers directory. You can run it like this: 
<pre class="code">
su root -c "./blanking" 
</pre> 
from within the Freevo helpers directory. It will disable screen blanking in the kernel for all the virtual terminals. 
<p>If you continue having the same problems in X you may find you can fix it with xset

<p>For watching tv in linux using a tv-tuner card the most common way of getting 
the tv sound input is by using a short audio cable that connects on one end 
to the tv card and the other end to the line-in jack on a sound card.  This 
way there is always audio data being pumped to the sound card's line-in.  
The most common problem is that the tv-tuner audio output is not connected 
correctly to the sound card input (usually line-in).  
Alternatively, the line-in has been muted, or the volume turned all the way down. 
<p>Note that freevo upon startup will mute the line-in and set the volume to zero. 
You should make sure that TV audio is indeed working properly outside of freevo before  
attempting to debug it within freevo. 
<p>In order to verify that tv audio is indeed being received by your sound card, 
use a mixer program (e.g., aumix, alsactl) and manually unmute and set the volume for 
the line-in. Then try viewing the TV channel from outside of freevo using either mplayer 
(you'll need to figure out the command line parameters), tvtime or xawtv / fbtv (for framebuffer mode) 
and determine if the sound works correctly. Alternatively, connect the tv audio output from 
the tv-card directly to the speakers (be careful about the volume!) if nothing else 
seems to be working. 
<p><a name="head-61aa1b643765a4ff0b24377847d5db7ef7624c4f"></a><H1>22 Why are the TV programs I've recorded totally silent?</H1>

<p>Now that you've managed to view TV programs correctly from within freevo, the next step is to try and 
record it. However, a common problem with recordings is that there's video, but the audio is silent. 
The line-in levels are set to a high value, and everything seems fine, right? 
<p>Unfortunately, in order for the recording program to actually record the sound you're hearing so well 
via the speakers, you also need to set another parameter: 
the "Capture Input". This is toggled using the space-bar from within the mixer program. 
In alsamixer, it appears in Red as "CAPTUR" above the audio input that you want to capture 
("- - - - - -" otherwise). In aumix, it toggles between a Red "R" (capturing) and a green "P" (not capturing). 
<p>You MUST enable the capture input even though you can hear the audio clearly through your speakers. 
<p>As an aside, Capture and Muting are two separate things. Mute refers to output to the speakers, 
while Capture refers to input that's sent to /dev/dsp (or whichever device is used in your system) 
in order for the audio recording to work. The Level determine the loudness of the audio that's  
captured or sent to the speakers. 
<p>You should try recording manually from the command line to verify that the mixer settings are set 
correctly before trying to debug it in freevo. The most common problem is that freevo resets 
the input levels automatically, causing the recording to be silent. Please read the <a href="/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/RecordingInfo">RecordingInfo</a> section for more details on controlling the mixer input levels for scheduled recordings. 
<p>Note: There's a variable in local_config.py "CONTROL_ALL_AUDIO" that can be set to zero to prevent 
freevo from muting and resetting input levels automatically. However, this will cause the tv audio 
to be heard via the speakers during a recording (which is probably not what you want). 
<p><a name="head-14972f0b8f130ffb67f411d8c4fad6165542a02a"></a><H1>23 How do I use DMA audio to play or capture sound via the PCI bus?</H1>

<p>For watching tv in linux using a tv-tuner card the most common way of getting 
the tv sound input is by using a short audio cable that connects on one end 
to the tv card and the other end to the line-in jack on a sound card.  This 
way there is always audio data being pumped to the sound card's line-in.  Any 
programs used to play or record this audio must be configured to get the stream 
from the line-in channel of the sound card's DSP resource (ie: /dev/dsp0).   
<p>The btaudio kernel module provides an alternate method of recording or playing 
sound from bt878 tv-tuner cards directly via the PCI bus, bypassing the sound card input 
and potentially results in better A/V sync. This is termed 'DMA Audio'. 
<p>For tv-tuner cards using other chipsets (e.g., Phillips SAA7134, Conextant cx88) 
there are equivalent capabilities available.  
<p>SAA7134-based cards do not need any additional kernel modules, an insmod option 'oss=1' will  
enable the DMA audio capture capability. This maps the DMA audio to the next available /dev/dsp? 
device (and may reorder the device numbering if the sound card module is loaded after the saa7134 module has loaded). It is advisable to load the saa7134 module only after the sound card modules are loaded to avoid this problem, as well as to specify the device number using mixer_nr and dsp_nr options. Go to <a href="http://bytesex.org">http://bytesex.org</a> for more information. 
<p>Note that SAA7130-based cards do not have this capability and can only capture 
audio via the sound-card. 
<p>From the linux kernel documentation: 
<pre class="code">
    Audio DMA support for bt878 based grabber boards.  As you might have 
    already noticed, bt878 is listed with two functions in /proc/pci. 
    Function 0 does the video stuff (bt848 compatible), function 1 does 
    the same for audio data.  This is a driver for the audio part of 
    the chip.  If you say 'Y' here you get a oss-compatible dsp device 
    where you can record from. 
</pre> 
<p>Please also read Documentation/sound/btaudio from the linux kernel source!  It 
has some valuable information. 
<p>So, if you think your tv card has this capability then try it out.  You will 
probably have to build your own kernel / this module yourself but may be 
lucky enough to have it included in your linux distribution.  There is another 
module that is called tvmixer which provides access to the sound mixer 
capabilities of these cards as well.  Both of these modules can be found in the 
sound section of the linux kernel configuration. 
<p>Once you have these modules compiled it is time to try them out.  The btaudio 
module has some important options.  If you read 'Documentation/sound/btaudio 
from the linux kernel source' you will see that btaudio may provide access to 
both a digital and analog audio source.  My tv card is capable of 16 bit stereo 
sound so I use the digital one.  For the record I am using an ATI TV-Wonder 
(regular edition) as my tv card.  Btaudio also has a 'rate' option which 
defaults to 32kHz so you will most likely not need to change this option but 
you should be aware of it. 
<p>To load btaudio I do the following: 
<pre class="code">
# modprobe btaudio analog=0 digital=1 
</pre> 
If I then type 'dmesg' to display the kernel messages I see: 
<pre class="code">
btaudio: driver version 0.7 loaded [digital] 
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 00:0b.1 
PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 00:01.1

btaudio: using card config "default" 
btaudio: registered device dsp1 [digital] 
</pre> 
For tvmixer (needed by btaudio only, not necessary for saa7134-based cards) you probably do not need to use any options so simply: 
<pre class="code">
# modprobe tvmixer 
</pre> 
Likewise: 
<pre class="code">
i2c-core.o: driver tv card mixer driver registered. 
tvmixer: debug: MSP3445G-B8 
tvmixer: MSP3445G-B8 (bt848 #0) registered with minor 16 
tvmixer: debug: Philips NTSC_M (MK2) 
</pre> 
<p>Ok, with any luck you now have these modules loaded.  It is time to try them 
out.  If you have a silly audio patch cable going from your tv card to your 
sound card remove now because you won't be needing it! But first please read caveat below. 
<p>Not all programs are capable of capturing audio using DMA audio via the PCI bus.   
Notably, most TV viewing programs (such as tvtime, mplayer, xawtv 3.x) are  
not able to use the DMA audio input for live viewing. This situation may change in future 
as DVB (digital video broadcast) capture cards become more common. 
<p>The tvtime FAQ notes a workaround for live TV viewing without the audio patch cable. 
See <a href="http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/help.html#noaudio">http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/help.html#noaudio</a> 
<p>Hence, DMA audio capture is currently limited to recording TV programs for later viewing. 
A few requirements come to mind.  You must be able to tell the program to capture 
at a sample rate equal to what btaudio is providing.  The default for btaudio 
is a rate of 32000 Hz.  Most programs will try to capture at a rate of 
44100 Hz so if you can't tell them otherwise what you hear will sound like 
Alvin and the Chipmunks :).  For saa7134-based TV-capture cards, the audio rate 
must be set to 32000 Hz or you won't get any sound! 
<p>Also you will need to specify which DSP resource 
to capture from, and sometimes which channel (line-in).  For me the DSP for 
my digital btaudio device is /dev/dsp1 as shown in the above kernel messages. 
There are also some other problems that occur when it comes to programs using 
a btaudio device.  Programs use functions called ioctls to control hardware 
and the btaudio device does not have all of the same functions that an OSS or 
ALSA driver will provide.  Therefore some programs will simply 'break' while 
attempting to access a btaudio device.  Some of the time this can be worked 
around by patching or editing the source code of the offending program. 
<p>Current versions of mencoder (1.0preX) has support for DMA audio. 
Another program that needs some help is mp1e.  There is a quick patch that 
can be applied to mp1e and it can be found in Aubin's freevo WIP directory, 
'freevo/WIP/Aubin/mp1e_btaudio.diff'. 
<p>For encoding I am quite fond of the nvrec tools, <a href="http://nvrec.sf.net">http://nvrec.sf.net</a> and

<p>There is since 1.0.0rc2 an equivalent of btaudio for alsa: snd-bt87x module. I use the following /etc/asound.conf: 
<pre class="code">

           type hw 
           card 0 
        } 
 
        ctl.emu10k1 { 
           type hw 
           card 0 
        } 
 
pcm.bt87x { 
           type hw 
           card 1

        ctl.bt87x { 
           type hw 
           card 1 
        } 
</pre> 
For using mencoder with ALSA, you must specfy the option 'alsa' and as device try 'bt87x' or 'emu10k1'. 
bt87x doesn't work for me (just like btaudio didn't), but emu10k1 works fine. Not using OSS has the advantage for me that I can record from line-in with volume control muted, hence ENABLING timeshift recording.

<p>For saa7134-based cards, the command for recording is a bit simpler. The v4lctl program which comes with xawtv is used to set the audio input level, since the saa7134 mixer device is OSS only and aumix doesn't provide sufficient control over the volume. 
<p>The following is placed in the /etc/freevo/local_config.py file under the VCR commands section (for freevo 1.5.x). Note that I'm using /dev/dsp1 for my AUDIO_INPUT_DEVICE. I left the mixer settings alone since the default works fine. If you're inclined to change the mixer settings, use 'aumix -d /dev/mixer1 [...] (saa7134 options mixer_nr=1 used to specify mixer number). Note that 'v4lctl volume XX' only affects the analog audio level for input via the audio patch cable into your soundcard, and is not needed for DMA audio recording.

<p>The simplest answer is any card with v4l or v4l2 drivers. The developers have had good experiences with the BTTV family of cards, produced by <a class="external" href="http://www.hauppauge.com/"><img src="/wiki/img/moin-www.gif" width="11" border="0" alt="[WWW]" hspace="4" height="11">Hauppauge</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.aver.com/products/tvtuner_AVerTV.shtml"><img src="/wiki/img/moin-www.gif" width="11" border="0" alt="[WWW]" hspace="4" height="11">Aver</a>.  They are typically the best supported under Linux, though the WinTV PVR cards from Hauppauge are not completely supported yet. Keep an eye on <a class="external" href="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/"><img src="/wiki/img/moin-www.gif" width="11" border="0" alt="[WWW]" hspace="4" height="11">ivtv.sf.net</a> if you're interested in hardware MPEG-2 encoding via those cards.

<p>Digital Cable in the United States has not been standardized. There are currently no support for tuning digital tv natively in freevo at the moment. Depending on your hardware (whether you have a serial or a port for recieving IR signals (looks like a headphone jack)) you might be able to use scripts to tune your digital cable box but these scripts will unfortuneately be hardware specific. Another option maybe an IR signal sender like IRblaster but again custom scripting will be required. 
Digital Cable users in Europe might be able to use linuxtv.org. 
<p><a name="head-c2dc4eda68a16d6e29014564dbbae44905f757d3"></a><H1>29 Why is the audio out of sync for watching TV, but working ok everywhere else?</H1>

<p>The problem is to do with how mplayer grabs video, versus audio for playing television. Mplayer grabs the video from the TV card and 
runs it through it's own layer before putting it on the screen, the audio, on the other hand, is passed through a cable from the TV card to your sound card (in most cases) and thus there is a delay, depending on the speed of your machine between the audio, and the video showing up the screen since the video must pass through mplayer first. 
<p>A number of solutions for this are being examined; if you have a fast machine, this probably won't occur, but for slower machines, we should have a workaround shortly.

<p>One error that prevents scheduled recordings from actually recording is as follows, check for this in the logfiles in /var/log/freevo/  NOTE: dont bother, add the fix anyways if it doesn't record.  the errors sometimes never show up.

<p>This is a very hard question. There are 3 main factors here. Your CPU power, how much video acceleration hardware is available and what kind of video capture card you have (if any). The best thing to do is searching the freevo-user mailing list. Freevo users are quite fond of small/silent machines and much of the generally available "minihardware" has been tried &amp; tested. You probably will find an answer there. 
<p>The Epia M10000 Mainboard is a good way to start, powerfull, and quiet. It can play DVD's and DivX using software only, but the M10000 features a hardware decoder wich can increase DVD performance further.

<p>No need to duck. This can be answered without shotguns<img src="/wiki/img/smile.gif" alt=" :) " height="15" hspace="6" width="15">.Theoretically the answer is "it should be possible". All main components of Freevo (python, sdl, mplayer) have windows ports in some form or another. SDL and Python for windows is no problem, mplayer &amp; probably some python modules will be much more of a problem. Mplayer will require at least Cygwin, and is far from as mature as its linux version. So somebody with insane patience and good knowledge of freevo, it's components, and the windows opensource ports could do it i think. Even if it would ever run on windows, you would miss out on the community and general knowledge of the freevo user/developper base. 
<p>Practically : it's way faster, better, easier and cooler to install linux and run freevo like it was intended to run. 
<p><a name="head-20ce003c4094adafe7169e252866e305542800a7"></a><H1>34 My media files are on a Windows share and I would like to use them</H1>

<p>I got a new machine and installed Linux and Freevo, but my MP3s and videos are shared on my Windows box and I want to keep them there.  How do I get Freevo to connect to the share? 
<p>You need to install and configure Samba (sometimes known as SMB).  Most Linux distributions support this and come ready out of the box.  Check that you have Samba installed and that your kernel has support for the smbfs module. If not, you may need to install Samba and/or recompile the kernel.  Next, create a mount point.  As root, type in <tt class="wiki">mkdir&#160;/mnt/computername</tt> where "computername" is the name of the Windows machine.  Next, tell your Linux box that the share is available and should be grafted into your filesystem at /mnt/computername by editing (also as root) the file /etc/fstab and appending the following line: 
<pre class="code">
//computername/sharename           /mnt/computername          smbfs    username=toto,password=tutu,owner,user,_netdev         0 0 
</pre> 
<p>If the share does not require a username and password, change the "username=blah,password=blah" to "guest".  The share should now be automatically mounted next time the machine is booted, or can be manually mounted with <tt class="wiki">mount&#160;/mnt/computername</tt> 
<p>Finally, add the mountpoint to freevo_conf.py to make Freevo aware of it. 
<p>Be advised that audio will stream over a Samba share pretty well, but video files might be a little choppy, depending on the speed of your network and how your other machines are using it.  It is highly advised to upgrade to a fast (100 megabit) ethernet and turn off bandwidth-hogging applications (P2P file sharing) if you will be watching large, high-quality, movies over a file share.

<p>I'm running Freevo in 800x600 fullscreen but my desktop has a resolution of 1280x1024. When playing a movie in Mplayer that is scaled and black borders are applied to the video to fit the screen there is only one big black border at the bottom of the screen. 
<p>The following steps fixed that problem: <ul>
<li> set MPLAYER_USE_WID to 0 in local_conf.py 
</li><li> change MPLAYER_ARGS_DEF: supply "-screenw 1280 -screenh 1024" to the other options (so MPlayer knows the size of your desktop resolution - replace values with your desktop resolution) </li></ul>
<p>Now when opening a video, resolution is changed back to normal and MPlayer plays centered fullscreen video.

<pre class="code">

./runtime/apps/freevo_python: error while loading shared libraries: libpng.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
</pre> 
<p>Then you need to install libpng 3. The problem here is that libSDL is trying to load a library and ignoring our LD_PRELOAD. 
This will hopefully be fixed by SDL in a future release

<p>Some windowmangers cause that kind of problems. To avoid it, use Freevo as windowmanger.  
Start Freevo with the option -fs and you get a new X-Window and the problems should be gone. 
<p>This may cause troubles with started application because there is no windowmanager. A different solution is to set MPLAYER_VO_DEV to 'sdl'. Different SDL applications seem to work with sharing fullscreen. Yet another solution is to tell your windowmanager to grab focus on all new windows. &lt;TODO: what are the settings for tvtime, xine, etc. to do that&gt; 
<p>Debian doesn't let us start up a new X-server by default from inside X (e.g. from Eterm). To allow 
that, the file /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config has to contain the following: allowed_users=anybody 
It must be readable by everybody as well. (to be continued<img src="/wiki/img/smile.gif" alt=" :) " height="15" hspace="6" width="15">)

<p>If you make your own VCD BINs with GNU VCD Imager and then burn them to CDs using cdrdao it is possible that all of your 
VCDs will have the same creation date and label.  (Apparently the creation date of the BIN file is used by cdrdao and if the BIN file is overwritten rather than created new each time every CD you burn would have the same creation date.)  Unfortunately, freevo uses the creation date and label to name files holding metadata about the CD, so it assumes that every CD with the same creation date/time and label is the same CD and it will not bother creating new metadata for it.  However, there is a way to work around this.  In local_conf.py set MMPYTHON_CREATE_MD5_ID = 1.  This will cause the filename of the metadata to include an md5 of the first byte of the disc and should make it more difficult for two CDs to share the same metadata file. It would also be a good idea to delete old BIN files (rather than overlay them) and create unique labels for VCDs that you burn. <a name="bottom"></a>

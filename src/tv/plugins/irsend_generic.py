# Revision 1.3  2004/02/02 22:22:14  outlyer
# For most cable boxes/satellite boxes, just punching in the channel isn't
# enough, you typically have to press 'enter' or 'select' afterwards. You
# can specify the NAME of the key to press after sending the command using
# enterkey.
#
# Revision 1.2  2003/11/25 16:32:33  rshortt
# Make plugin_external_tuner work again.
#
# Revision 1.1  2003/11/23 20:32:05  rshortt
# This is a plugin for sending IR commands to an external tuner.  You can
# specify your irsend command when you plugin.activate.
#
# This is totally untested as irsend doesn't work with my receiver.  If you
# would like to use this give it a try and notify of any problems or modify
# it to work correctly.  It is now merely a proof of concept.

#RSS FEED FILES AND DIRECTORIES
RSS_FEEDS='/etc/freevo/rss.feeds'
RSS_VIDEO='/opt/media/tv/'
RSS_AUDIO='/opt/media/podcasts/'

You will need to make a rss.feeds file: it contains the URL and the number of
days it's been published (7 days since it's been published, in this example):

#/etc/freevo/rss.feeds file
http://twit.libsyn.com/rss,7
http://leo.am/podcasts/twit,7
http://leo.am/podcasts/itn,7

You can start it; with the following command:
freevo rssServer start
You can stop with the following command:
freevo rssServer stop

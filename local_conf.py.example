# Plugins:

# you can remove all plugins loaded in freevo_config.py
#
# Examples:
# plugin.remove(plugin_tv) or

# plugin.remove(rom_plugins['image']) will remove the rom drives from the
#   image main menu,
# plugin.remove('rom_drives.rom_items') will remove the rom drives from all
#   menus


# Use this ivtv_record instead if you have an ivtv based card (PVR-250/350)
# and want freevo to do everthing for you.  TV_SETTINGS must be set 
# correctly.  To use you need the following two lines in local_conf.py:
# plugin.remove('tv.generic_record')
# plugin_record = plugin.activate('tv.ivtv_record')

# For joystick support:
# plugin.activate('joy')

# control an external tv tuner using irsend or another command
# to use this you must reassign plugin_external_tuner in local_conf.py:
# plugin_external_tuner = plugin.activate('tv.irsend_generic',
#                                         args=('...', '...', ))
# Please see each irsend plugin for individual arguments and be sure to
# alter VIDEO_GROUPS to tell a VideoGroup to use it (tuner_type='external').

# Idlebar plugin:

# plugin.activate('idlebar')
# plugin.activate('idlebar.mail',    level=10, args=('/var/spool/mail/dmeyer', ))
# plugin.activate('idlebar.tv',      level=20)

# replace tuner_id in the following example with a valid tuner id (ie: '5' or
# 'BBC1') and a frequency in KHz.  You may have as many entries as you like,
# anything here will simply override a coresponding entry in your standard

#
# TV Channels. This list contains a mapping from the displayed channel name
# to the actual channel name as used by the TV watching application.
# The display name must match the names from the XMLTV guide,
# and the TV channel name must be what the tuner expects (usually a number).
#
# The TV menu is supposed to be supported by the XMLTV application for
# up to date listings, but can be used without it to just display
# the available channels.
#
# This list also determines the order in which the channels are displayed!
# N.B.: You must delete the XMLTV cache file (e.g. /var/cache/freevo/TV.xml.pickled)
#       if you make changes here and restart!
#
# Format: [('xmltv channel id', 'freevo display name', 'tv channel name'), ...]
#
# If this variable is set to None (default), Freevo will try to auto-detect
# the channel list based on the xmltv file. This doesn't work for all
# xmltv grabber, e.g. the German list doesn't contain station lists. In this
# case Freevo will output the possible list for you to add them manually.
#
# If auto-detection doesn't work or you want to edit the list, run
# freevo tv_grab -query.
#
# Setting this variable to [] will deactivate the tv guide. If you don't have
# a tv card, you may also want to add plugin.remove('tv') to remove the whole
# tv menu.
#
# All channels listed here will be displayed on the TV menu, even if they're
# not present in the XMLTV listing.
# 
#
# Timedependent channels:
#
# The TV_CHANNELS-list can look like this:
#
# TV_CHANNELS = [('21', 'SVT1',              'E5'),
#                ('22', 'SVT2',              'E3'),
#                ('26', 'TV3',               'E10'),
#                ('27', 'TV4',               'E6'),
#                ('10', 'Kanal 5',           'E7'),
#                ('60', 'Fox Kids',          'E8', ('1234567','0600','1659')),
#                ('16', 'TV6',               'E8', ('1234567','1700','2359'), 
#                                                  ('1234567','0000','0300')),
#                ('14', 'MTV Europe',        'E11') ]
#
# As you can see the list takes optional tuples:
# ( 'DAYS', 'START','END')
#
# 1234567 in days means all days.
# 12345 would mean monday to friday.
#
# It will display "Fox Kids" from 06:00 to 16:59 and "TV6" from 17:00 to 03:00. 
# 03:00 to 06:00 it won't be displayed at all.

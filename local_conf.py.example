#
# Notes:
#    This file contains the freevo settings. To change the settings
#    you can edit this file, or better, put a file named local_conf.py
#    # in the same directory and add your changes there.  E.g.: when
#    you # want a alsa as mplayer audio out, just put
#    "MPLAYER_AO_DEV = # 'alsa9'" in local_conf.py
#
#    This is no normal config file, it's Python code. Because of that, you 
#    need to follow some rules to avoid crashes. The examples should explain
#    the settings, but make sure a line starting with a variable has 
#    NO SPACES OR TABS at the beginning.

# This list also determines the order in which the channels are displayed!
# N.B.: You must delete the XMLTV cache file (e.g. /var/cache/freevo/TV.xml.pickled)
#       if you make changes here and restart!
#
# Format: [('xmltv channel id', 'freevo display name', 'tv channel name'), ...]
#
# If this variable is set to None (default), Freevo will try to auto-detect
# the channel list based on the xmltv file. This doesn't work for all
# xmltv grabber, e.g. the German list doesn't contain station lists. In this
# case Freevo will output the possible list for you to add them manually.
#
# If auto-detection doesn't work or you want to edit the list, run
# freevo tv_grab -query.
#
# Setting this variable to [] will deactivate the tv guide. If you don't have
# a tv card, you may also want to add plugin.remove('tv') to remove the whole
# tv menu.
#
# All channels listed here will be displayed on the TV menu, even if they're
# not present in the XMLTV listing.

#
# TV_CHANNELS = [('21', 'SVT1',              'E5'),
#                ('22', 'SVT2',              'E3'),
#                ('26', 'TV3',               'E10'),
#                ('27', 'TV4',               'E6'),
#                ('10', 'Kanal 5',           'E7'),
#                ('60', 'Fox Kids',          'E8', ('1234567','0600','1659')),

#
# As you can see the list takes optional tuples:
# ( 'DAYS', 'START','END')
#
# 1234567 in days means all days.
# 12345 would mean monday to friday.
#
